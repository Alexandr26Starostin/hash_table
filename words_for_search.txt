There
was
large
audience
assembled
on
the
14th
of
January
1862
at
the
session
of
the
Royal
Geographical
Society
No
Waterloo
Place
London
The
president
Sir
Francis
—
made
an
important
communication
to
his
colleagues
in
an
address
that
was
frequently
interrupted
by
applause
This
rare
specimen
of
eloquence
terminated
with
all

the
following
sonorous
phrases
bubbling
over
with
patriotism
“England
has
always
marched
at
the
head
of
nations”
for
the
reader
will
observe
the
nations
always
march
at
the
head
of
each
other
“by
the
intrepidity
of
her
explorers
in
the
line
of
geographical
discovery
”
General
assent
“Dr
Samuel
Ferguson
one
of
her
most
glorious
sons
will
not
reflect
discredit
on
his
origin
”
“No
indeed
”
from
all
parts
of
the
hall
“This
attempt
should
it
succeed”
“It
will
succeed
”
“will
complete
and
link
together
the
notions
as
yet
disjointed
which
the
world
entertains
of
African
cartology”
vehement
applause
“and
should
it
fail
it
will
at
least
remain
on
record
as
one
of
the
most
daring
conceptions
of
human
genius
”
Tremendous
cheering
“Huzza
huzza
”
shouted
the
immense
audience
completely
electrified
by
these
inspiring
words
“Huzza
for
the
intrepid
Ferguson
”
cried
one
of
the
most
excitable
of
the
enthusiastic
crowd
The
wildest
cheering
resounded
on
all
sides
the
name
of
Ferguson
was
in
every
mouth
and
we
may
safely
believe
that
it
lost
nothing
in
passing
through
English
throats
Indeed
the
hall
fairly
shook
with
it
And
there
were
present
also
those
fearless
travellers
and
explorers
whose
energetic
temperaments
had
borne
them
through
every
quarter
of
the
globe
many
of
them
grown
old
and
worn
out
in
the
service
of
science
All
had
in
some
degree
physically
or
morally
undergone
the
sorest
trials
They
had
escaped
shipwreck
conflagration
Indian
tomahawks
and
war-clubs
the
fagot
and
the
stake
nay
even
the
cannibal
maws
of
the
South
Sea
Islanders
But
still
their
hearts
beat
high
during
Sir
Francis
—
‘s
address
which
certainly
was
the
finest
oratorical
success
that
the
Royal
Geographical
Society
of
London
had
yet
achieved
But
in
England
enthusiasm
